# Email-Provider

This is the repo for Client side of the project. 

## Project Setup
- Clone repo
- You must have node and npm install.
- Install node packages using npm install
- Run the frontend using command: *npm run dev*

## Project Structure & Details
- App is built on Nextjs using create-next-app.
- Folder structure consists of Pages, Components, Styles.
- Pages/index is our Homepage. I have implemented a simple form using Formik on the homepage.
- I have also used YUP for schema validation for form inputs.
- Components consists of reuseable components which can be utilized throuhout the workspace. 
- Styles includes global css file and css module files for different components and pages.
- I have created a Stats page which displays the information about the Email Providers.
- I used Axios for consuming APIs.

## End Notes
- I barely completed the exercise in the given time. It took me more time on building the backend.
- Due to time limit I wasn't able complete the frontend and polish it. My focus was to complete functionality first.
- It was my first Nextjs project so I needed to go through documentation to setup and grasp key concepts.

If given more time other than completing the exercise, 1) I would have created models and migration for the backend. 2) Would improve the UI and UX for the client side. 3) Would have used Nextjs concepts like pre rendering. 4) Would have used (Nextjs added support for) different styling libraries or pre-processors.
